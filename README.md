Snag'em is the latest workout/sharing-economy app. It connects more experienced athletes with less experienced athletes, taking advantage of the statistically likely chance that experienced athletes will follow-through on workouts, and in-person committments motivate less experienced athletes more than current technologies. Snag'em allows users to coach activities they are comfortable in, and tagalong on events that they are newer to them.
